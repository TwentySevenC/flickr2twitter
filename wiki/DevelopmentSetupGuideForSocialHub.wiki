==Download the Source Code==
First of all, you would also need a SVN client for playing with the source code. You can try with [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html TortiseSVN] and [http://subclipse.tigris.org/download.html SubClipse] for working with Eclipse.

You can check [http://code.google.com/p/flickr2twitter/source/checkout this page] for where download the source code. If you also intend to make contribution to our project, please do let me know(yuyang226@gmail.com) and I will consider if we can enroll you as a commiter for the project. 

Please remember that checking in changes would require a generated password from http://code.google.com/hosting/settings. Your gmail password would not work in this case.
