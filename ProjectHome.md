Please don't let the project name confuse you. It can not just handle Flickr and Twitter, but has been designed in a manner for interacting with any online services.

The initial idea of project was meant for those who love both Flickr and Twitter. It allows automated integration between your Flickr and Twitter accounts. Any latest Flickr public uploads will be automatically posted to Twitter at a specified time interval.

This has been further enhanced to support China's leading micro-blog service Sina. Please stay tune as we will soon support more source/target services.

Please start using this project by following the [installation guide](http://code.google.com/p/flickr2twitter/wiki/InstallationGuide).

We also have a mirrored Git repository at https://github.com/yuyang226/SocialHub
